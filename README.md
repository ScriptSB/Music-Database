# Music-Database
Accessing a database of music information through a web application â€” PHP/HTML/CSS/MySQL

Tasked with creating a web applciation that hooks into a MySQL database, my two team members and I decided to create a searchable music library. Users can search songs, artists, albums, and genres from a predefinied database. They are then directed to matching results and are able to click on each result to navigate to the corresponding page. Each query pulls information from the database and artwork from the web to display a stylish and easy to navigate webpage complete with embedded YouTube videos of each song. A search field for new queries runs at the bottom of every page.
